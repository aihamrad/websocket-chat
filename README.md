This code defines a React component App that implements a simple WebSocket chat application. The application is based on the useWebSocket hook from the react-use-websocket library, which handles the WebSocket connection for the component.

The component has state variables for the WebSocket URL socketUrl, the text of the message to be sent message, and the history of messages received and sent messageHistory.

The component uses the useWebSocket hook to establish the WebSocket connection and receive updates about the connection status. The hook returns functions for sending messages and retrieving the last message received and the connection status.

The component listens for changes to the lastMessage using useEffect and appends each new message to the messageHistory.

The component also has a button that allows the user to connect to the server. The connectToServer function updates the socketUrl to a different server when clicked.

When the connection is open, the component displays a form with an input field for the message text and a send button. The handleClickSendMessage function is called when the form is submitted, sending the message and clearing the input field. The component also displays the connection status, updating the display based on the current readyState of the connection.

Finally, inside Messages component there's a StringFix function that takes a message and its index and returns a component with the message displayed based on whether it was sent or received.
